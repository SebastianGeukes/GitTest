This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(a = rnorm(100), b = rnorm(100))
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
ggplot(df, aes(a, b)) + geom_point(color = "red") + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
